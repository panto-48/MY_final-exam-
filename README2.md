So first the code only produce 1 picture with slower size inside but we need more !!!! based on command so first I start by make input command then make variable to retain that value then I skip go 
#Lock the shape wiith choice : 
1,5 triangle 2,6 square 3,7 pentagon and 4,8 is random so how I rock I make the variable that control how the shape will be like to be specific number (I think you ciuld know more than me how it work)
#seperate groups:
so it look like it will make 1.)independent group 2.)cover group(sorry I don't know what it call) so I seperate it base on choice 1-4 is group 1 , 5-8 is group 2
#Real work (Group1)
So I use function that already in the file to build shape with help of random it not that hard to make random independant multiple shape picture
#Real work (Group2)
It more a bit complex but long story short I use the function for decrease the size that already in code and use my turtle code to move the picture from the corner
